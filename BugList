API:

1. URL array is blank (but might not be an issue as can't save videos right now- come back to this when we can)

2. Consider which methods in which controllers are superfluous, and which are required but aren't currently doing anything (e.g. they have unfunctional code copy/pasted from another controller)


Client:

3. Can't access TechniqueType.find props(for category and sub-category) to cache these for their fields in the TechniqueUpdatePage.js form. This needs to be done async to finish after Technique.details finishes. Likewise, for video information.
Fixed. I think. Check!

4. Sometimes when e.g. going to update the difference content, you can't; the form just can't be filled out. May have fixed this but watch out in case it manifests again.

5. When updating the video, it borks. Ditto difference content ?/? is_different. 
"TypeError: Converting circular structure to JSON
    --> starting at object with constructor 'HTMLButtonElement'
    |     property '__reactFiber$koq63rqnbo' -> object with constructor 'FiberNode'
    --- property 'stateNode' closes the circle"
    
    Now a purple belt technique is lost to the ether...
    
6. Page load doesn't work e.g. for async functions in UpdateTechniqueForms

7. Ensure that the create and update pages are in line with each other and different where required

8. CSS doesn't work on: WhatIsJiuJitsu.js (including inline?), SyllabusShowPage.js, TechniqueShowPage.js,

9. Sometimes can't post techniques and not sure why

10. When page jumps to awkward location on load for half-width

11. Is it possible to make the highlighted menu option the right colour (instead of garish orange) on Chromium?

12. Is NotFound page being used? Try to, if not required, remove it. Same with CreatedAt and Technique Summary. Modularise more.

13. More illustrative error messages, if possible don't let the pages fail on bad input, but warn the user as to why they're failing

14. If a technique isn't fully filled out in the form, trying to submit it will work but then the technique is "invisible" in the front end. So, need to guard against this so that the filling out of the entire (or majority) of the form is required.

15. Remove redundant fetch request from update function.

16. The first technique is showing a "video" which shouldn't be there, perhaps because it's reading the UK version as nil

17. Similarly ensure video captions won't show for videos which don't exist

18. Ensure that videos are removed if on edit their fields are blank

19. Ensure that video times are updating after edit- and that null videos aren't being created (this doesn't affect other parts of the update form)

20. Ensure that is_different is correct on the update form based on the backend

Both:

15. Code cleanup, remove redundant print statements and commented out blocks which will never be used
